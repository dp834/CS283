the fd stack starts with 0 1 2 filled for stdin stdout and stderr
opening fd1 gives it next number available so 3
opening fd2 gives it next number available so 4
closing fd2 gives its number back to fd stack so 4 can be used again
opening fd2 again gives it the next number available so 4 again

program will print 
fd2 = 4
