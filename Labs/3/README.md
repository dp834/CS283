To make all run 
	make

to make client run
	make client

to make server run
	make server

No special assumptions made

Test cases:
use 
	make test

This will create three files
clientTestFile       - This is what the client sees when the ping google.com for index.html
serverTestFile       - What the server sees
clientServerTestFile - What the client sees when it sends a request to the server for the Makefile
